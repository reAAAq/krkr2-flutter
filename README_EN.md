## Overview

**krkr2-flutter** is a modernized rewrite of the KrKr2 emulator, designed to run visual novel games built with the **KiriKiri engine** (a.k.a. T Visual Presenter). It replaces all non-core engine components with the Flutter framework, bridging the native C++ engine via FFI / Platform Channels. The graphics layer is powered by [ANGLE](https://chromium.googlesource.com/angle/angle), which provides a unified abstraction supporting modern graphics APIs such as Metal, Vulkan, and Direct3D 11, enabling high-performance rendering across macOS, Windows, Linux, Android and more.

## Current Progress

The project has completed a full migration from the legacy OpenGL rendering pipeline to modern graphics APIs. The engine rendering layer is now unified through ANGLE, which automatically selects the optimal graphics backend on each platform — **Metal** on macOS, **Direct3D 11** on Windows, and **Vulkan** on Linux. Engine render frames are delivered to Flutter via platform-native texture sharing mechanisms (IOSurface / D3D11 Texture / DMA-BUF) with zero-copy transfer. The emulator UI is being actively built on the Flutter framework.

The screenshot below shows the current running state on macOS with the Metal backend:

## Architecture

**Rendering Pipeline**: The engine performs offscreen rendering via ANGLE's EGL Pbuffer Surface (OpenGL ES 2.0). Rendered frames are delivered to the Flutter Texture Widget through platform-native texture sharing mechanisms (macOS → IOSurface, Windows → D3D11 Texture, Linux → DMA-BUF) with zero-copy transfer.
