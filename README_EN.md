## Overview

**KrKr2 Next** is a modern, cross-platform runtime for the [KiriKiri2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KiriKiri) visual novel engine. It is fully compatible with original game scripts, uses modern graphics APIs for hardware-accelerated rendering, and includes numerous optimizations for both rendering performance and script execution. Built on Flutter for a unified cross-platform UI, it targets macOS · iOS · Windows · Linux · Android.

The screenshot below shows the current running state on macOS with the Metal backend:

## Architecture

</p>

**Rendering Pipeline**: The engine performs offscreen rendering via ANGLE's EGL Pbuffer Surface (OpenGL ES 2.0). Rendered frames are delivered to the Flutter Texture Widget through platform-native texture sharing mechanisms (macOS → IOSurface, Windows → D3D11 Texture, Linux → DMA-BUF) with zero-copy transfer.


## Development Progress

> ⚠️ This project is under active development. No stable release is available yet. macOS is the most advanced platform.

| Module | Status | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| C++ Engine Core Build | ✅ Done | KiriKiri2 core engine compiles on all platforms |
| ANGLE Rendering Migration | ✅ Mostly Done | Replaced legacy Cocos2d-x + GLFW pipeline with EGL/GLES offscreen rendering |
| engine_api Bridge Layer | ✅ Done | Exports `engine_create` / `engine_tick` / `engine_destroy` C APIs |
| Flutter Plugin | ✅ Mostly Done | Platform Channel communication, Texture bridge |
| Zero-Copy Texture Rendering | ✅ Mostly Done | Zero-copy engine render frame sharing to Flutter via platform-native texture mechanisms |
| Flutter Debug UI | ✅ Mostly Done | FPS control, engine lifecycle management, rendering status monitor |
| Input Event Forwarding | ✅ Mostly Done | Mouse / touch event coordinate mapping and forwarding to the engine |
| Engine Performance Optimization | 🔨 In Progress | SIMD pixel blending, GPU compositing pipeline, VM interpreter optimization, etc. |
| Game Compatibility | 🔨 In Progress | Completing the script parser, adding plugins. Current goal: match compatibility with Z's closed-source build |
| Original krkr2 Emulator Feature Porting | 📋 Planned | Gradually port original krkr2 emulator features to the new architecture |

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Graphics Backend | Texture Sharing |
|----------|--------|-----------------|----------------|
| macOS | ✅ Mostly Done | Metal | IOSurface |
| iOS | 🔨 Pipeline Working, Optimizing OpenGL Rendering | Metal | IOSurface |
| Windows | 📋 Planned | Direct3D 11 | D3D11 Texture |
| Linux | 📋 Planned | Vulkan / Desktop GL | DMA-BUF |
| Android | 🔨 Pipeline Working, Optimizing | OpenGL ES / Vulkan | HardwareBuffer |

## Engine Performance Optimization

| Priority | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| P0 | Pixel Blend SIMD ([Highway](https://github.com/google/highway)) | ✅ Done |
| P0 | Full GPU Compositing Pipeline | 🔨 In Progress |
| P0 | TJS2 VM Interpreter (computed goto) | ✅ Done |

## Recent Updates

- **TJS2 VM computed goto optimization**: On GCC/Clang platforms, replaced the traditional switch-case dispatch with direct threaded dispatch (labels-as-values). Eliminates the central branch bottleneck — each opcode gets its own indirect jump, allowing the CPU branch predictor to learn per-opcode jump patterns. Expected 15-25% script execution speedup. MSVC automatically falls back to the original switch-case path with zero compatibility risk.
